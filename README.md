# Synthea Data Analysis

This repository contains a series of Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for cleaning, processing, and analysing synthetic healthcare data generated by the Synthea simulator, with a focus on hypertension analysis. The project includes data cleaning, data validation, and statistical analysis related to blood pressure, BMI, and hypertension prevalence.

## Project Overview

This repository focuses on cleaning and analysing the synthetic healthcare data produced by the [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) simulator. The analysis primarily examines hypertension-related data, including blood pressure and BMI metrics.

### Analysis Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   The raw Synthea data is cleaned in a series of scripts, starting with patient data and continuing through conditions, observations, medications, and encounters.

2. **Data Analysis:**  
   Once the data is cleaned, the project performs statistical analysis on key indicators like hypertension prevalence, blood pressure (BP), and BMI across different patient populations.

3. **Reporting & Visualisation:**  
   The final results are summarized in reports, including figures and tables generated during analysis.

## Install

To get started, you can set up the environment using `pip`. First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/babak2/synthea_data-analysis.git
cd synthea_data-analysis 
```


Then, install the required dependencies:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Required Libraries

The project requires the following key Python libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning

- **numpy**: For numerical operations

- **matplotlib** and seaborn: For data visualization

- **jupytext**: To work seamlessly with Jupyter notebooks and scripts

For a full list of dependencies, check out the requirements.txt file.



## Running the Scripts

The repository contains Python scripts that can be executed independently or together in sequence. Here's how you can run them:

1. Run individual Python scripts:
    Each script is designed to be executed in sequence. You can run any script individually using Python:

    ```python archive/scripts/01_patient_cleaning.py```
    ```python archive/scripts/02_conditions_cleaning.py```
    ... and so on for each script




2. Execute the integrated Jupyter notebook:
The final analysis is contained in the synthea_data-analysis.ipynb notebook. You can execute the entire analysis in one go:


      ``` jupyter notebook synthea_data-analysis.ipynb ```



## Data

The raw Synthea data files can be placed in the data/original/ directory. After running the cleaning scripts, the processed data will be saved in the data/processed/ directory. Here's an example of the data structure:



data/
├── original/   # Raw data
│   ├── patients.csv.gz
│   ├── conditions.csv.gz
│   ├── observations.csv.gz
│   └── ...
└── processed/  # Cleaned data
    ├── clean_patients.csv
    ├── clean_conditions.csv
    ├── clean_observations.csv
    └── ...
